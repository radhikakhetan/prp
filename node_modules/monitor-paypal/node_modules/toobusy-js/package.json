This will catch more latency spikes\n// but may cause the check to be too sensitive.\ntoobusy.interval(250);\n\n// Get current maxLag or interval setting by calling without parameters.\nvar currentMaxLag = toobusy.maxLag(), interval = toobusy.interval();\n```\n\nThe default maxLag value is 70ms, and the default check interval is 500ms.\nThis allows an \"average\" server to run at 90-100% CPU\nand keeps request latency at around 200ms.\nFor comparison, a maxLag value of 10ms results in 60-70% CPU usage,\nwhile latency for \"average\" requests stays at about 40ms.\n\nThese numbers are only examples,\nand the specifics of your hardware and application can change them drastically,\nso experiment!\nThe default of 70 should get you started.\n\n## references\n\n> There is nothing new under the sun. (Ecclesiastes 1:9)\n\nThough applying \"event loop latency\" to node.js was not directly inspired by anyone else's work,\nthis concept is not new.  Here are references to others who apply the same technique:\n\n  * [Provos, Lever, and Tweedie 2000](http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html#tips) - \"notes that dropping incoming connections when the server is overloaded improved the shape of the performance curve.\"\n\n## license\n\n[WTFPL](http://wtfpl.org)\n",
