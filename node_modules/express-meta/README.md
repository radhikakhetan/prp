express-meta
============

Middleware module to allow seeing information about the configuration and running stats for an application from
within the corporate firewall. Also supports ECV checks.


### URLS

It adds these following URLS in an app:

1. /meta - Shows the Metadata information about the app in JSON format. e.g. https://www.msmaster.qa.paypal.com/ABC_NODE_APP/meta
2. /ecv - Used by OPS to ping the app. It shows if app is routable. Powered by [ecv-paypal](https://github.paypal.com/NodeInfra/node-ecv-paypal)


### Meta rules

Meta contains lot of useful app runtime/config information. Here are ways to construct meta urls.
 - DEV and Stage: for home page, meta url is - https://www.msmaster.qa.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/home/meta. You can access all this information directly.
 - Sandbox/LIVE: Because of security reasons, meta information can only be accessed via Siteview for a specific host as https://slcmppnodeweb3003b.slc.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/home/meta. On the other hand https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/home/meta will just return the manifestId.
